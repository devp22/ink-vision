This is because PyTorch internally calls forward() when you pass data through the model. If you name the method anything other than forward(), PyTorch won't automatically call it

    # The MNIST dataset has pixel values in the range [0, 255]. Normalization scales them to [0, 1] (via ToTensor()) and further to zero-centered values using (mean=0.1307, std=0.3081), which improves model training.

    # The Dataset retrieves our dataset’s features and labels one sample at a time. While training a model, we typically want to pass samples in “minibatches”, reshuffle the data at every epoch to reduce model overfitting, and use Python’s multiprocessing to speed up data retrieval.

    # A loss function is used to measure how well the CNN is performing on the training data. The loss function is typically calculated by taking the difference between the predicted labels and the actual labels of the training images.
    # An optimizer is used to update the weights of the CNN in order to minimize the loss function.
    # Learning Rate is the step size used for each iteration of the model training process. A learning rate that's too high can cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, and one that's too low might make the training process too slow.
    # num_epochs indicates the number of times the entire dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network.
